Here is my solution to the classification problem based on the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention dataset. 

**Data description:**
- The dataset consists of 12,330 sessions. 
- The data set was formed in such a way that each session belongs to different users for 1 year. 
- The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. 
- The 'Revenue' attribute is the class label.

This is my project on the AI education course.
